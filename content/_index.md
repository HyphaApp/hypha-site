## What is Hypha?

Hypha is an submission management platform for open funding calls. Funding organisations can manage the full funding application process - from creating a fund to ongoing project invoicing.

It can be hosted on your own Internet infrastructure, which means your data is yours.

Being built on open source software means you have the power to modify the Hypha code. It can be tailored for your needs.

## How Hypha helps you manage your full submission pipeline

Hypha is a provides a funding organiser with a way to manage the whole submission pipeline:

### Manage funds

It can manage single or multiple funding rounds - e.g. recurring rounds, annually, once-off.

### Create single or multiple rounds

You can create single or multiple application rounds for your fund, depending on your organisations needs.

### Build forms

With Hypha you can create all the forms needed for your fund: application, review, deciding forms etc.

### Review and analyse submissions

Applications can be reviewed by internal, external advisors, or both.

### Communicate with applicants

Once the review process has completed Hypha helps you manage communications between you and applicants.

### Manage post-application process

You can also manage the post-application process important tasks using Hypha. We will be expanding to support invoicing and payments.

### Automate workflows and integrate with other services

You can automate repeated workflows. You can also integrate Hypha with other automation and notification services (Slack for notifications, Mailgun for email communications, etc)

## Data ownership - your data is yours

Unlike other submission management platforms Hypha is self-hosted.

This means that the applications, and all associated information created is available to you and your applicants on your own systems - not handed over to a company where it can be difficult to analyse the data.

## Privacy is important

The Hypha code is regularly audited. It has many privacy and security features.

## Benefit from the powers of open source

Hypha is open source software. This means the license invites you to expand what can do Hypha, create add-on functionality not already available.

All we ask is you contribute these improvements back to the project so others can benefit.

## Technology

Hypha itself is built on many open source software projects. We use [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Wagtail](https://wagtail.io/), and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

View our [Roadmap](https://github.com/HyphaApp/hypha/wiki/Roadmap) for upcoming features and enhancements.

Hypha [source code is hosted on Github](https://github.com/HyphaApp/) and [development takes](https://github.com/HyphaApp/hypha/issues) place in the open.
