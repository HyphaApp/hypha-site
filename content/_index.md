## What is Hypha? ## 

Hypha is an open source submission management platform to receive and manage applications for funding. [Try Our Demo](https://sandbox.opentech.fund/)

Developed internally by Open Technology Fund (OTF) and community partners, Hypha is an easy to use, secure, and privacy-focused application and project management system for application reviewers, prospective and current funding recipients, and project managers. Our goal is to facilitate open, accessible, and reproducible code to individuals and organizations working to build a more equitable world.

- **Manage the whole submission pipeline**. Hypha gives you the flexibility to create application forms you need for multiple funding rounds at the same time.
- **Participatory and collaborative review process**. Managers can easily navigate through the platform to evaluate proposals and share their assessments with internal or external stakeholders. 
- **Connect with applicants and grantees on the platform**. Integrate with other messaging services like Slack, Zulip, Signal, and Mailgun among others for notifications.
- Since its inception, **transparency, security, and trust** have been core components of what has driven Hyphaâ€™s development: 
  - 100% open source. Improving the sustainability of open source software is a core component of the Hypha platform. 
  - Implement best practices in Django security to prevent attacks and mitigate vulnerabilities.
  - Your data is yours. Hypha is self-hosted. This means that the applications and all associated information created is available to you and your   
    applicants on your own systems - not handed over to a company where it can be difficult to analyze the data.
  - Two-factor authentication to enhance your account security with the free Android or IOS authenticator apps.
- **Comprehensive API**. Anything you see on screen, you can also do via an API call.

**Hypha Community** We offer several virtual meeting spaces, including communication forums, chat room channels, and an open GitHub repository for new and current adopters. Join our forums to discuss new features and report bugs for continuous improvement of the platform. [Get Started](https://we.hypha.app/)
