# What is Hypha?

Hypha is an submission management platform for open funding calls. It provides a funding organisation with a way to manage the application process from creating a fund to invoicing.

## Manage the full submission pipeline

Hypha provides a funding organiser with a way to manage the whole submission process:

- Manage funds
Hypha can manage single or multiple funding rounds - e.g. recurring rounds, annually, once-off.

- Create single or multiple rounds
You can create single or multiple application rounds for your fund, depending on your organisations needs.

- Build forms
With Hypha you can create all the forms needed for a fund: application, review, deciding forms etc.

- Review and analyse submissions
Applications can be reviewed by internal, external advisors, or both.

- Communicate with applicants
Once the review process has completed Hypha helps you manage communications between you and applicants.

- Manage post-application process
You can manage the post-application process important tasks using Hypha also. We will be expanding to support invoicing and payments.

## Data ownership - your data is yours

Unlike other submission management platforms Hypha is self-hosted.

This means that the applications, and all associated information created is available to you and your applicants on your own systems.

## Have a need? Modify Hypha to expand
Hypha is open source software. This means the license invites you to expand what can do Hypha, create add-on functionality not already available.

All we ask is you contribute the improvements back to the project so others can benefit.
